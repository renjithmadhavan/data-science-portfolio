Converting R markdown to jekyll markdown

one method is from http://brooksandrew.github.io/simpleblog/articles/blogging-with-r-markdown-and-jekyll-using-knitr/

Another method is method #2 from
http://jason.bryer.org/posts/2012-12-10/Markdown_Jekyll_R_for_Blogging.html

I'm using this method (I think, I don't remember I installed it a few weeks ago):

To convert rmarkdown to markdown, place rmarkdown (.Rmd file) in _knitr folder. Then in terminal, go to _knitr folder and run 

$./buildsite.sh -c 

to see other options just run

$./buildsite.sh
