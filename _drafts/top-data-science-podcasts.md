Podcasts are a great way to shorten a long commute or to make working out an exercise for your brain as well as your body. 

Here is my list of data science podcasts and why you should give them a listen. 

#5. Data Stories
Starting off our list is a very professional podcast run by Enrico Bertini and Moritz Stefaner.

#4. Not-so-standard deviations
Roger Peng and Hilary Parker

#3. What's the Point, Fivethirtyeight
If you are interested in political polling Fivethirtyeight certainly has you covered. However, they also explore non-political topics as well on their website and on this podcast. This might be the most main stream, large audience podcasts on the list. 

#2. Data Skeptic
This podcast has a very intimate feel, as host Kyle Polich often discusses various data science topics with his wife Linh Da. 

#1. Partially Derivative



Am I missing an amazing data podcast or do you have suggestions to add to the list? Add a comment below and let me know!
